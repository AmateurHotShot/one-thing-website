# January - One Thing

## VERSION 1

The one thing you're supposed to do today in order to be successful.

Saves each day's entry so that you can look back on them like a journal entry

opens every time you make a new tab

A "What should I add? / What's wrong?" button

Do NOT have it be timed, let the user decide that for themselves. That way, they can do stuff like set a task for tomorrow, have a task span several days, or whatever they need to do.

Have a success or a move on button, NOT a fail button

Work on:

- If it's your first day, do NOT show the "view past days" button

## VERSION 2

Show what **other** people are working on today.

You can follow what other people are doing that day (connect to their twitter?)

Success streaks - how many days you've done what you've set out to do.
